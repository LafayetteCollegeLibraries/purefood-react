            These maps show the spread of state-level oleomargarine regulation
            in the later 1800s. Oleomargarine was invented in 1869 by the French
            chemist Hippolyte Mege-Mouries. The Mege Patent, as it came to be
            known, followed from research in animal fats and oils and a decree
            by Napoleon III to preserve milk supplies with a substitute for
            butter. In 1873, the first oleo factory opened in the United States
            when another French chemist, Alfred Paraf, stole the Mege Patent
            and claimed it as his own. (Chapter 1 tells his story.) Four years
            later, New York was the first state to regulate its production as
            a substitute for butter. Chapter 5 narrates the ways oleomargarine
            and butter grew in tandem within a protracted debate about artificial
            and natural products.

            Oleomargarine legislation lasted deep into the twentieth century,
            by which point makers had dropped the “oleo” prefix and referred
            to it as margarine. Color laws were famous for dramatic gestures, 
            requiring pink margarine in some cases or, as readers of a certain
            age may remember, a color packet that customers bought alongside
            the margarine at the store and mixed in the product at home. As
            recently as 2007, Quebec still had laws on the books prohibiting
            the manufacture of margarine. Those laws began in 1877. The
            series of legislative maps here span the first near-quarter
            century of regulation to show the base point from which twentieth
            century laws followed.

            In addition to “no legislation,” there were four levels of
            regulation in the first quarter century of margarine sales.
            New York’s 1877 legislation required margarine producers to label
            their products as such. A second level of regulation required
            margarine producers either to color their product something other
            than white—purple was one of the first options—or not color it at
            all to keep it white. In either case, the point of color laws was
            to state that margarine producers could not sell “butter” yellow
            margarine. A third level of regulation taxed the margarine per
            pound. This became more prominent after U.S. Congress passed the
            federal 1886 Oleomargarine Law. A final level was to prohibit
            outright the production and sales of oleo, much as many states today
            prohibit raw milk. Full data sets of the states and types of
            legislation are <Link to="/notes">here</Link>.
